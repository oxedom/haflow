For each Emission in the front end I want to be able to view all the logs. So it's important to add a new feature that when a process is selected, when a mission is selected, we have an option to view all the logs. So I'd say generally on the back end, I once... it to be very verbose and save everything. Like... because we're opening a container and I want to see all the information from the container, from the processes. because we can run a dev environment inside us. For each mission, I want to view all the logs.
