## Progress Log

### 2026-01-15 - IMPL.TYPES.ENUMS Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `packages/shared/src/index.ts` with all state enums
- Implemented MissionState, TaskStatus, ProcessStatus, and LogLevel enums
- All enum values use string values that match expected database column values

**Files created:**
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @ralphy/shared build` passes
- All 4 verification steps from PRD confirmed

**Next recommended priority:**
- IMPL.TYPES.STATE_MACHINE - Create state transition validator (depends on enums just implemented)
- This will enable IMPL.REPO.MISSIONS to validate state transitions

**Notes:**
- The backend package doesn't have source files yet so `pnpm build` will fail on backend - this is expected
- The shared package builds and exports correctly

---

### 2026-01-15 - IMPL.TYPES.STATE_MACHINE Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `packages/shared/src/state-machine.ts` with state transition validator
- Implemented `VALID_TRANSITIONS` constant mapping each MissionState to its valid next states
- Implemented `isValidTransition(from, to)` function that returns boolean
- Re-exported both from `packages/shared/src/index.ts`

**Files created:**
- `packages/shared/src/state-machine.ts`

**Files modified:**
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (added re-exports)

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @ralphy/shared build` passes
- All 4 verification steps from PRD confirmed:
  - VALID_TRANSITIONS maps each state to array of valid next states
  - draft -> generating_prd is valid
  - prd_review -> generating_prd (reject) and preparing_tasks (approve) are valid
  - isValidTransition returns boolean

**State machine transitions implemented:**
- draft -> generating_prd
- generating_prd -> prd_review, completed_failed
- prd_review -> generating_prd (reject), preparing_tasks (approve), completed_failed
- preparing_tasks -> tasks_review, completed_failed
- tasks_review -> preparing_tasks (reject), in_progress (approve), completed_failed
- in_progress -> completed_success, completed_failed
- Terminal states (completed_success, completed_failed) have no valid transitions

**Next recommended priority:**
- IMPL.DB.INIT or IMPL.DB.SCHEMA - These are foundational for all repository implementations
- IMPL.ERRORS - Custom error classes needed for InvalidStateTransitionError in repositories

**Notes:**
- Both Types features (IMPL.TYPES.ENUMS and IMPL.TYPES.STATE_MACHINE) are now complete
- The shared package is fully functional and ready for backend to consume

---

### 2026-01-15 - IMPL.ERRORS Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `packages/backend/src/utils/errors.ts` with custom error classes
- Implemented `NotFoundError` with resource and id properties
- Implemented `ValidationError` with ZodIssue[] issues property
- Implemented `InvalidStateTransitionError` with from and to properties
- All error classes properly extend Error with correct name property for instanceof checks
- Used Object.setPrototypeOf pattern for proper ES6 class inheritance
- Created minimal `packages/backend/src/index.ts` entry point that exports errors

**Files created:**
- `packages/backend/src/utils/errors.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/index.ts` (minimal, exports errors)

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @ralphy/backend build` passes
- All 4 verification steps from PRD confirmed:
  - NotFoundError has constructor(resource: string, id: string)
  - ValidationError has issues: ZodIssue[] property
  - InvalidStateTransitionError has from: string and to: string properties
  - All errors have proper name property for instanceof checks

**Next recommended priority:**
- IMPL.UTILS.ID - ID generator utility (needed by all repositories)
- IMPL.DB.INIT - Database initialization (foundational for repositories)
- IMPL.DB.SCHEMA - Database schema (needed before any repository implementation)

**Notes:**
- The backend package now has source files and builds successfully
- Error classes are ready for use in IMPL.MW.VALIDATION, IMPL.MW.ERROR, and IMPL.REPO.MISSIONS
- Tests fail due to no test files existing yet - this is expected until IMPL.TEST.* features are implemented
